# 👋 Hi, I’m @zemanue
## 👨‍🏫 I’m currently a Primary School Teacher in my first steps in development.
At the moment, I’m focused on learning everything I can about programming, making code as clear as possible with comments in Spanish (teacher issues, I guess…)
- 🧑‍🎓 Studing DAM (Multi-platform Application Development) at DigitechFP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, SQL, HTML and CSS... 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: personal projects that challenge me to find possible solutions and learn more in the process :)
- 📫 How to reach me: manureco.97@gmail.com
- 🔜 Next goals: JavaScript, Python...
